This is a simple wrapper for the Linux version of Juniper's Network Connect VPN
software.  It intercepts calls to modify the routing table, to prevent it from
adding or deleting specific routes.

The IGNORED_TARGETS array at the top of rtwrap.c controls which route targets
should be ignored.

To build it, just run "make".  To install it, run "make install" as root.
By default it looks for a network connection installation in your home
directory, and installs there.  Modify the paths at the top of the Makefile to
control this.  (Run "make clean && make" after modifying these paths.)

Use at your own risk.  It's not my fault if it makes your computer blow up.
